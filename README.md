# Lego_and_Accelerators
Here we can watch an Accelerator made out of lego. The wholde movement is based on air pumps. Is the cost of a Lego accelerator infinite?--->I think not, yet people are not interested. The hard part is designing it...you need to sit down pen and paper and imagine...If you are able to imagine it then it shouldn't be too difficult to design it. Designing it however can get a bit difficult when there is no interest. It also needs some funny/playfull mood approach. Impossible is nothing!!! Enjoy!
